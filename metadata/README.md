# Datamart MetadataThe `datamart-meta.py` script pulls metadata from both the ISI and NYU Datamarts. ## UsageFirst, insert the appropriate Datamart credentials into the `config.ini` file. Then run:```python3 datamart-meta.py```This generates two metadata files (one for each Datamart).## OutputThe `ISI_metadata.jsonl` file is a JSON lines file where each line contains normalized metadata about a _variable_ within the ISI Datamart.The `NYU_metadata.jsonl` file is a JSON lines file where each line represents normalized metadata about a _dataset_ within the NYU Datamart.
